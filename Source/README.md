### Requirements

* Node 8.9.4\*
* Yarn >= 1.7.0\*\*
* Python 2.7.X\*\*\*

<sub>\*Higher versions should work fine, but may cause inconsistencies. It's suggested you run 8.9.4 using `nvm`.</sub>
<br/>
<sub>**npm is NOT supported for package management. SafeWallet uses yarn.lock to ensure sub-dependency versions are pinned, so yarn is required to install node_modules</sub>
<br/>
<sub>\***Python 3 is **not** supported, since our dependencies use `node-gyp`.</sub>
<br/>
<sub>\***For users trying to build with WSL, you'll need to have install libpng via `sudo apt-get install libpng16-dev`.</sub>

### Running the App

After `yarn`ing all dependencies you can run various commands depending on what you want to do:

#### Development

```bash
# run app in dev mode in browser, rebuild on file changes
yarn dev
```

#### Build Releases

```bash
# builds the production server app
yarn build
```

building adds output to a folder in `dist/`.
